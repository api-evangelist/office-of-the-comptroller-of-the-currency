  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a federal agency
  responsible for regulating and supervising national banks and federal savings
  associations. The OCC ensures that these financial institutions operate in a
  safe and sound manner, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and treat
  customers fairly. The agency conducts regular examinations of banks to assess
  their financial condition and risk management practices, and takes enforcement
  actions when necessary to address deficiencies. The OCC also works to promote
  stability and confidence in the banking system, while also fostering
  innovation and competition within the industry. By overseeing the operations
  of national banks and federal savings associations, the OCC helps to protect
  the interests of depositors, borrowers, and the overall economy.
